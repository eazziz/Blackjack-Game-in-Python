# Blackjack Game

## Overview

Welcome to the Blackjack Game project! This interactive project allows you to play a classic game of Blackjack against the dealer. Using Python, we simulate the game mechanics and give you a chance to test your luck and strategy.

## Project Flow

1. **Game Setup**:
   - The game begins by shuffling a standard deck of cards and dealing two cards to both the player and the dealer.

2. **Gameplay**:
   - Players can choose to hit (take another card) or stand (keep their current hand).
   - The goal is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer without going over (busting).

3. **Card Values**:
   - Cards 2-10 are worth their face value, while Kings, Queens, and Jacks are worth 10. Aces can be worth 1 or 11, depending on what benefits the player most.

4. **Dealer's Turn**:
   - Once the player stands, the dealer reveals their hand and must hit until they reach a minimum hand value of 17.

5. **Determining the Winner**:
   - The game evaluates the hands and determines the winner based on the closest value to 21 without busting. The results are displayed to the player.
